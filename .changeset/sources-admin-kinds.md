The Sources admin screen no longer hardcodes "Tautulli" as the only connectable source type. It now fetches the list of registered adapter kinds from a new `GET /sources/kinds` endpoint and lets users pick any of them (Tautulli, Plex, BookLore, BookOrbit, Grimmory, Audiobookshelf, RomM), showing the right credential fields (API key, token, or OPDS username/password) for whichever kind is selected.
