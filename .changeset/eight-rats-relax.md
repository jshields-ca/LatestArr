**New:** Import a Plex or Tautulli source's known users as recipients, grouped together, from the Sources page.

<details>
<summary>Technical details</summary>

`SourceAdapter` (`packages/adapters/core/src/source-adapter.ts`) gains an optional `listUsers?(config): Promise<SourceUser[]>`, the same optional-capability pattern as `fetchPopularItems`/`fetchImageBytes`. Implemented for:

- **Tautulli**, via its `get_users` API (`getUsers` in `tautulli-client.ts`) — includes each user's `email` when Tautulli has it (synced from the underlying Plex server's shared-user list), filtering out its "Local" pseudo-user (id 0).
- **Plex**, via the local server's own `/accounts` endpoint (`getAccounts` in `plex-client.ts`) — usernames only, no email. A local server token can't reach plex.tv's own account API, which is the only place a shared user's email is visible; `SourceUser.email` is optional specifically to let a caller (and `NewItem`'s doc comment) handle this per-source gap rather than assuming every source can supply one.

New `GET /sources/:id/users` (`apps/server/src/http/routes/sources.ts`) 404s (not a 200 with an empty array) when the adapter doesn't implement `listUsers`, so the web UI can tell "unsupported" apart from "zero users right now."

New "Import users" action on a Plex/Tautulli source row (`apps/web/src/pages/sources-page.tsx`) opens a dialog listing the source's users — pre-checked when they have an email, disabled when they don't (a recipient can't exist without one) — and imports the selected ones via the existing bulk-import endpoint (`POST /recipients/import`, from the CSV/text-paste import feature), then adds each newly-created recipient to a group named after the source, reusing an existing group of that name on a repeat import rather than creating a duplicate.
