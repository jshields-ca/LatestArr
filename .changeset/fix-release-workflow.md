Fix the release workflow's first real run, which crashed immediately: `changesets/action` unconditionally reads each bumped package's own `CHANGELOG.md` to build the "Version Packages" PR description, but the previous PR disabled per-package changelog generation entirely (`"changelog": false`), so that file never existed and the action threw `ENOENT`. Reverted to Changesets' default per-package changelog generation — those files are internal bookkeeping the action needs, not something a self-hoster needs to read. `scripts/write-changelog.mjs` still writes the single consolidated root `CHANGELOG.md` entry the actual GitHub Release pulls its notes from; nothing about the human-facing changelog changes.
