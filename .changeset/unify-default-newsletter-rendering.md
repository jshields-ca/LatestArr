Fix the "default layout" (no custom template picked) newsletter render falling back to a stale, pre-poster hardcoded template with no images and no MJML compilation. It now renders through the same MJML pipeline as a custom GrapesJS template, so a default-layout send gets the same poster + metadata cards, responsive layout, and Outlook/MSO compatibility.
