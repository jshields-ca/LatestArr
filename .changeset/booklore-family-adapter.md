Add a BookLore-family adapter (`@latestarr/adapter-booklore-family`) covering BookLore and its compatible forks BookOrbit and Grimmory. These expose their library through OPDS (a standardized Atom-based catalog format, HTTP Basic Auth) rather than a stable internal REST API, so this adapter parses OPDS feeds directly. Since all three forks share the same OPDS surface, this ships as a single adapter factory rather than three near-duplicate implementations — `bookloreAdapter`, `bookOrbitAdapter`, and `grimmoryAdapter` differ only in their `kind` identifier.
