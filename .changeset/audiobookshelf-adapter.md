Add an Audiobookshelf adapter (`@latestarr/adapter-audiobookshelf`) for connecting audiobook/podcast libraries — authenticates with a bearer token against Audiobookshelf's documented REST API, listing libraries and their recently-added items. Unlike Tautulli/Plex/BookLore, Audiobookshelf has no cross-library "recent items" endpoint, so when no specific libraries are selected the adapter discovers all libraries first and queries each one.
