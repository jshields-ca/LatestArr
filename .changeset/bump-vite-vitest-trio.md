Bump vite (6 → 8, apps/web only), vitest (4 → 5, every package), and @vitejs/plugin-react (4 → 6, apps/web only). Dev-tooling only, no runtime dependency changes.

Bumped all three together since they're an interlocking build/test toolchain — vitest 5 pins a vite 6+ peer, and @vitejs/plugin-react needs to track the vite major it's paired with. `pnpm turbo run lint typecheck build test` is fully green (40/40 tasks, 189 server tests, 225 web tests); no config changes needed in `apps/web/vite.config.ts` or any `vitest.config`.
