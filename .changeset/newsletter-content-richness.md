Addresses the most common piece of v0.6.0 production feedback: newsletters rendering "very plain, no images/posters/covers." Only the RomM adapter ever populated `posterUrl` — Plex, Tautulli, Audiobookshelf, and the BookLore family all left it empty, so their items never got a poster in the default template or a Media List block, even though the rendering side already supported one.

Wires poster/cover art through for all four remaining adapters: Plex maps its `thumb` field to a token-bearing absolute URL; Tautulli adds the `thumb`/`art` fields its API was already returning but the client wasn't reading, resolved through its own `pms_image_proxy` command; Audiobookshelf maps `media.coverPath` to its token-bearing cover endpoint; and the BookLore-family client gains real OPDS `<link rel="...image">` parsing (preferring the full image over the thumbnail), which it had none of before.

Rather than putting a source's own URL (frequently LAN-only, and often carrying that source's credentials as a query param) directly into a sent email, a new pipeline step (`apps/server/src/pipeline/embed-images.ts`) fetches each item's image server-side at send time — using the same stored, decrypted credentials the pipeline already polls that source with, via a new `SourceAdapter.fetchImageBytes()` (replacing the previously unimplemented `resolveImageUrl`) — resizes it to a thumbnail with `sharp`, and attaches it to the outgoing email as a Nodemailer CID attachment. The rendered HTML references it with `<img src="cid:...">`; a recipient's mail client never makes an outbound request of its own. This is applied uniformly to the default template and to the GrapesJS Media List block. Every step fails soft, per item: an unreachable source, a failed fetch, or an image `sharp` can't decode just drops that one item's poster rather than failing the whole send.

Also, from the same feedback:
- **TV episode titles**: a `tv_episode` item's prominent title was just the bare episode name (e.g. "Winter Is Coming"), with the series name buried in the subtitle — it now leads with the series title, with "SxxExx - Episode Name" as the subtitle, for both Plex and Tautulli. Rendered items also now show a release date alongside the added date when the source provides one.
- **Content-kind labeling**: BookLore-family items are now labeled "Ebook", "Comic", or "Book" (derived from the OPDS acquisition link's MIME type), and Audiobookshelf items "Audiobook" or "Podcast", surfaced as a small badge next to the title in both the default template and the Media List block — without widening the shared `MediaKind` enum for it.
- **Smarter Media List blocks**: a new "Random order" trait picks random items from the matching pool instead of always the first N; a new "Show all items in the period" trait removes the count cap entirely; and a new "When nothing matches this period" trait offers a random-items-instead fallback (sampled from an all-time pool, only fetched when a block actually needs it) or a plain link back to the source, instead of silently rendering an empty section.
