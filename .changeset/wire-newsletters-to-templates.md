Wire newsletters to templates: the Newsletters admin screen now has a Template picker (set at creation, or changed/unset on an existing newsletter) with a direct link into the GrapesJS builder for the linked template. The Newsletter CRUD API accepts `templateId` on create and update (including explicit `null` to unlink). This completes the newsletter builder feature end-to-end — a newsletter can now actually use a custom-designed template for its sends.
