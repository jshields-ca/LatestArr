Fix a real bug in `.changeset/config.json`: every workspace package is `private: true` (this app isn't published to npm), and Changesets' default `privatePackages.version: false` silently skips versioning any private package — meaning every changeset merged since Phase 3 has bumped nothing, and `pnpm version-packages` has been a silent no-op the entire time despite reporting success. Fixed by setting `privatePackages.version: true`.

Also adds the missing release automation: `.github/workflows/release.yml` opens/updates a "Version Packages" PR whenever changesets are pending on `main` (via `changesets/action`), and cuts a git tag + GitHub Release (with notes pulled from `CHANGELOG.md`) on the push that merges it — this app has no npm package to publish, so "release" means a tag and a GitHub Release, not `npm publish`. Changesets' own per-package changelog generation is disabled (`"changelog": false`) in favor of `scripts/write-changelog.mjs`, which writes one consolidated root `CHANGELOG.md` entry instead of scattering a `CHANGELOG.md` across every internal workspace package — this is a single self-hosted app, not a set of independently-consumed libraries.
