Make the GrapesJS template builder keyboard-operable. Previously the block panel, layer manager, and every other builder panel button were unreachable by Tab (GrapesJS renders them as plain `<span>`s with no tabindex), and blocks could only be added by dragging — a keyboard-only user had no way to open the builder's panels or add a block to a newsletter layout at all. Panel buttons and blocks are now focusable and Enter/Space-activatable, and every block gets a non-drag "click to add" fallback (appends to the end of the canvas), matching what GrapesJS's own docs recommend for this exact gap.
