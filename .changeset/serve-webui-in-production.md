Serve the built admin WebUI directly from apps/server in production, so the Docker image is usable end-to-end instead of API-only. Every backend route now lives under `/api` so it can never collide with a client-side route of the same name (e.g. `/sources` the admin page vs. `/sources` the endpoint) now that both are served from one origin.
