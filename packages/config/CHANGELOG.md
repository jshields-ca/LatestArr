### Patch Changes

- 51311b4: Bump eslint (9 → 10) and @eslint/js (9 → 10) across every package, and jsdom (25 → 29.1.1) in apps/web's test environment. Dev-tooling only, no runtime dependency changes.

  The Dependabot PRs for eslint/@eslint/js (#97, #105) failed CI with a stale, out-of-sync pnpm-lock.yaml on their branch — reproduced locally with a freshly regenerated lockfile and confirmed all 40 lint/typecheck/build/test tasks pass cleanly; `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`'s declared peer range hasn't caught up to eslint 10 yet, but it lints without error in practice.

  jsdom's own Dependabot PR (#104) proposed 25 → 30, but jsdom 30 dropped Node 20 support entirely (`engines: "^22.22.2 || ^24.15.0 || >=26.0.0"`), which broke this repo's Node 20.x CI job with `TypeError: webidl.util.markAsUncloneable is not a function` — a real Node-runtime incompatibility, not a lockfile issue. Landing on 29.1.1 instead (the latest jsdom release that still supports Node 20.19+) gets most of the version currency without dropping Node 20 CI support, which is a bigger call than a routine dependency bump.
