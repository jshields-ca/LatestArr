### Minor Changes

- 6c9dbfa: Add an Audiobookshelf adapter (`@latestarr/adapter-audiobookshelf`) for connecting audiobook/podcast libraries — authenticates with a bearer token against Audiobookshelf's documented REST API, listing libraries and their recently-added items. Unlike Tautulli/Plex/BookLore, Audiobookshelf has no cross-library "recent items" endpoint, so when no specific libraries are selected the adapter discovers all libraries first and queries each one.
- 20b13fd: Add a BookLore-family adapter (`@latestarr/adapter-booklore-family`) covering BookLore and its compatible forks BookOrbit and Grimmory. These expose their library through OPDS (a standardized Atom-based catalog format, HTTP Basic Auth) rather than a stable internal REST API, so this adapter parses OPDS feeds directly. Since all three forks share the same OPDS surface, this ships as a single adapter factory rather than three near-duplicate implementations — `bookloreAdapter`, `bookOrbitAdapter`, and `grimmoryAdapter` differ only in their `kind` identifier.
- f253894: Add the admin WebUI's authentication flow: a first-run setup screen to create the initial admin account, a login page (local credentials, plus a "Continue with SSO" option when OIDC is configured), session-aware route protection that redirects unauthenticated visitors to sign in, and a logout control. Adds a small `GET /auth/providers` endpoint so the frontend can detect whether OIDC is enabled and whether the initial admin account has been created yet.
- a55c7cf: Add the drag-and-drop newsletter builder: a GrapesJS-based editor (`/templates/:id/edit`, code-split so its ~700kB isn't shipped to every page) with a curated MJML block set plus a custom block library — Header, Footer, and a dynamic Media List block. Media List is the one genuinely dynamic block: a user configures it entirely through three Traits (Content type, Sort, Count) with no HTML/CSS knowledge required, and it exports as a `{{#mediaList ...}}` Handlebars block helper that the server's render pipeline resolves against real item data at send time — including a "most watched" sort backed by the Tautulli `fetchPopularItems` capability added in an earlier release. The Template API now accepts `compiledMjml` on create/update so the builder's export can be persisted alongside the reusable `designJson` project data.
- 1194bec: Add an MJML render pipeline: newsletters linked to a template now render via that template's compiled MJML (substituting real item data through the same Handlebars data-binding layer as the built-in starter template, then compiling to safe, Outlook/Gmail-friendly HTML with `mjml`), falling back to the hardcoded starter template when no custom template is linked or it has no compiled MJML yet.
- ac35fc1: Add a direct Plex adapter (`@latestarr/adapter-plex`) as an alternative to Tautulli for users who don't run a separate Tautulli instance — connect straight to a Plex Media Server using its own token-based API (`X-Plex-Token`), listing libraries and recently-added movies/TV episodes/seasons the same way the Tautulli adapter does.
- 10830fa: Add a RomM adapter (`@latestarr/adapter-romm`) for connecting game ROM libraries — authenticates with a RomM Client API Token (bearer auth) against its documented REST API, listing platforms as libraries and recently-added ROMs. Unlike Audiobookshelf, RomM's rom-listing endpoint accepts a repeatable `platform_ids` filter directly, so a multi-library fetch is a single request rather than a per-library loop.
- 646d74b: Serve the built admin WebUI directly from apps/server in production, so the Docker image is usable end-to-end instead of API-only. Every backend route now lives under `/api` so it can never collide with a client-side route of the same name (e.g. `/sources` the admin page vs. `/sources` the endpoint) now that both are served from one origin.
- d1f0de8: The Sources admin screen no longer hardcodes "Tautulli" as the only connectable source type. It now fetches the list of registered adapter kinds from a new `GET /sources/kinds` endpoint and lets users pick any of them (Tautulli, Plex, BookLore, BookOrbit, Grimmory, Audiobookshelf, RomM), showing the right credential fields (API key, token, or OPDS username/password) for whichever kind is selected.
- f576990: Add the Template CRUD API (create/list/get/update/delete), persisting the drag-and-drop builder's design JSON — a prerequisite for the upcoming GrapesJS builder, which will save to this endpoint.
- 2b58d0c: Wire newsletters to templates: the Newsletters admin screen now has a Template picker (set at creation, or changed/unset on an existing newsletter) with a direct link into the GrapesJS builder for the linked template. The Newsletter CRUD API accepts `templateId` on create and update (including explicit `null` to unlink). This completes the newsletter builder feature end-to-end — a newsletter can now actually use a custom-designed template for its sends.

### Patch Changes

- bc683eb: Fix the release workflow's second crash: `changeset version` auto-formats every `CHANGELOG.md` it touches with the project's own Prettier config (`.prettierrc.cjs` exists at the repo root) by shelling out to `pnpm exec prettier`, but `prettier` was never actually installed as a dependency — only its config file existed. Added `prettier` as a root devDependency so that auto-format step, and the config file that's been sitting unused, actually works.
- a4c79b7: Fix the release workflow's first real run, which crashed immediately: `changesets/action` unconditionally reads each bumped package's own `CHANGELOG.md` to build the "Version Packages" PR description, but the previous PR disabled per-package changelog generation entirely (`"changelog": false`), so that file never existed and the action threw `ENOENT`. Reverted to Changesets' default per-package changelog generation — those files are internal bookkeeping the action needs, not something a self-hoster needs to read. `scripts/write-changelog.mjs` still writes the single consolidated root `CHANGELOG.md` entry the actual GitHub Release pulls its notes from; nothing about the human-facing changelog changes.
- 66c45b5: Fix a real bug in `.changeset/config.json`: every workspace package is `private: true` (this app isn't published to npm), and Changesets' default `privatePackages.version: false` silently skips versioning any private package — meaning every changeset merged since Phase 3 has bumped nothing, and `pnpm version-packages` has been a silent no-op the entire time despite reporting success. Fixed by setting `privatePackages.version: true`.

  Also adds the missing release automation: `.github/workflows/release.yml` opens/updates a "Version Packages" PR whenever changesets are pending on `main` (via `changesets/action`), and cuts a git tag + GitHub Release (with notes pulled from `CHANGELOG.md`) on the push that merges it — this app has no npm package to publish, so "release" means a tag and a GitHub Release, not `npm publish`. Changesets' own per-package changelog generation is disabled (`"changelog": false`) in favor of `scripts/write-changelog.mjs`, which writes one consolidated root `CHANGELOG.md` entry instead of scattering a `CHANGELOG.md` across every internal workspace package — this is a single self-hosted app, not a set of independently-consumed libraries.
